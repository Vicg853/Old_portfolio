## My first webpage 
This is the first ever webpage (portfolio I made), fully made by pure: HTML5, CSS3 and JS.
I updated it a little bit some time ago, creating a little express server, only to serve the files staticly from a NodeJS server.

## Installation
##### First, let's download the project
_Must have: [Node.Js](https://nodejs.dev/) installed_
##### With git clone the repository (or download and extract the zip file)
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Vicg853/main_client.git
cd ElectionsCVL2020
```
<details>
    <summary>_In case you downloaded and extracted the Zip file_</summary>
    <p>
        ```cd [download repository path]/main_client```
    </p>
</details>

##### Then use [NPM](https://docs.npmjs.com/) package manager to download dependencies and run the project...
```bash
npm install
```
_To run it, do..._
```bash
npm install
npm run start
```
##### Now you should be able to access the project on your brwoser...
...Just access [Localhost 3001](http://localhost:3001/).
